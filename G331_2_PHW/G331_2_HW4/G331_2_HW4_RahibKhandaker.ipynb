There is two queries that have almost the same layout except for the predicate. They both select the customerid and employeeid from the sales.order table and then create a predicate to get the range of dates that gets activity from the month of January 2016 in one table and Febuary 2016 in the other. After the two queries are made we intersect them to combine the results into one table that shows the customer and employee of orders in the two months. Also, since the dates are specific they are present in northwinds database but not in tsqlv6 so I had to switch it back to tsqlv4.</span>"
